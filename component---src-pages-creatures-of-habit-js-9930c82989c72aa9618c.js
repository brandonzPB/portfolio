So the purpose of this app is to do just that: provide a nostalgic alternative \n    to apps that measure areas of your life the way a video game measures experience points and character evolution.\n  ',tech:'\n    I used React to create this project because it seemed like the best choice, with its packages, hooks, and state management. \n    I also used NodeJS and Express to create the server because I really enjoy building with JavaScript and I was eager to learn how to \n    make a "full-stack" web app with just one programming language. I also used MongoDB because of the scalable cloud services it provides. \n  ',lessons:'\n    The number of lessons I learned from this project alone is too many to detail in a simple paragraph! \n    Firstly, due to the complex structure of the "creature" objects, I learned a tremendous amount about the importance of refactoring code \n    and building a project that is clean and easy to maintain. \n    I also learned about the importance of writing unit tests before coding any of the project itself. \n    Another important concept I learned was the necessity of having a plan when designing any project: I learned what \n    works for me, how to mitigate my weaknesses, and make great use of my strengths. I used this plan when creating mindful.io.\n  ',thumbnail:e[e.length-1],screenshots:e.slice(0,e.length-1),alt1:"A serene painting of a light blue sky, a grassy field, and the ocean",alt2:"Screenshot of the Creatures of Habit app; \n    a Pokemon called Porygon with a nickname of duck.js has various habits, \n    such as studying and practing\n  ",icon:"creatures"};return n.createElement(r.Z,null,n.createElement(i.Z,null,n.createElement(s.Z,{title:"Creatures of Habit (Pok√©mon version) | BZWEB"}),n.createElement(l.Z,{projectProps:t}),n.createElement(c.Z,{otherA:{link:"/Republic_310",title:"The Republic 310",alt:"The landing page of The Republic 310.

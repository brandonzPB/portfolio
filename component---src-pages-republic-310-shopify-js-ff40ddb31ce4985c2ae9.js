Due to their small budget, \n    they could not afford a whole team of individuals with different skills; fortunately, I was able to\n    offer my solutions and help them meet their needs. And thus, the most cost-effective solution was \n    to launch their business with Shopify and continue with it until they were able to switch to the \n    full-stack template I made (link below). Not only was I able to produce the websites for them, but I \n    also completed the graphic design work by creating the logo and labels with Adobe Photoshop.\n  ",tech:"\n    This project is quite simple as I only used Shopify to build and design a custom theme. \n  ",lessons:"\n    I learned a surprising amount from completing this version of their website. Essentially, I gained\n    a greater understanding of Shopify Liquid and how to use it more effectively. Moreover, I picked up\n    some neat Photoshop techniques and tricks along the way. Lastly, I learned a lot about the business side\n    of e-commerce, and was able to put my economics degree to good use while assisting the team in \n    planning and executing the most cost-effective solutions.\n  ",thumbnail:e[e.length-1],screenshots:e.slice(0,e.length-1),alt1:"The landing page of The Republic 310.",alt2:"blank",icon:"republic"};return n.createElement(s.Z,null,n.createElement(a.Z,null,n.createElement(l.Z,{title:"The Republic 310 (Shopify version) | BZWEB"}),n.createElement(r.Z,{projectProps:t}),n.createElement(h.Z,{otherA:{link:"/Creatures_of_Habit",title:"Creatures of Habit",alt:"Serene painting of a light blue sky, a grassy field, and the ocean in between",name:"painting-creatures"},otherB:{link:"/Republic_310",title:"The Republic 310",alt:"Logo of The Republic 310",name:"republic310-0"}})))}}}]);

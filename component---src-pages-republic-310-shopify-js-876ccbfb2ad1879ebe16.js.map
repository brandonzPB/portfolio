And thus, the most cost-effective solution was \n    to launch their business with Shopify and continue with it until they were able to switch to the \n    full-stack template I made (link below).

Lastly, I learned a lot about the business side\n    of e-commerce, and was able to put my economics degree to good use while assisting the team in \n    planning and executing the most cost-effective solutions.\n  `\n\n  const alt1 = `The landing page of The Republic 310.`\n\n  const alt2 = \"blank\"\n\n  const otherA = {\n    link: \"/Creatures_of_Habit\",\n    title: \"Creatures of Habit\",\n    alt:\n      \"Serene painting of a light blue sky, a grassy field, and the ocean in between\",\n    name: \"painting-creatures\",\n  }\n\n  const otherB = {\n    link: \"/Republic_310\",\n    title: \"The Republic 310\",\n    alt: \"Logo of The Republic 310\",\n    name: \"republic310-0\",\n  }\n\n  const projectProps = {\n    title: \"The Republic 310 (Shopify version)\",\n    details,\n    stack,\n    link,\n    sourceCode,\n    purpose,\n    tech,\n    lessons,\n    thumbnail,\n    screenshots,\n    alt1,\n    alt2,\n    icon: \"republic\",\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <NavLayout>\n      <ProjectLayout>\n        <SEO title=\"The Republic 310 (Shopify version) | BZWEB\" />\n        <Project projectProps={projectProps} />\n        <ProjectFooter otherA={otherA} otherB={otherB} />\n      </ProjectLayout>\n    </NavLayout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Republic_310\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

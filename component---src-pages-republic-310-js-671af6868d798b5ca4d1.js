However, after working with it, seeing its advantages over regular JavaScript,\n    and ultimately learning how to write cleaner code with fewer bugs--I fell in love.

Although a simple solution,\n    something I never would've thought of or would have been able to do prior to my studies and rigorous practice was \n    creating a module that uses a quicksort algorithm to sort by the given parameters, along with TypeScript to\n    check for the data types of the different input arrays. \n    Also, I've not only learned a lot about better practices for writing code in a \n    reusable fashion, but also found a wealth of resources to dive into and further my knowledge and ability to work with everything\n    React has to offer. I certainly would not have grown without electing to use TypeScript over JavaScript for this project, nor would\n    I have been directed down a far more grand path of wisdom, knowledge, and practice so soon in my career.

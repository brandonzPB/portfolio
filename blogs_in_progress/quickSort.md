Ever wondered why you would ever need to learn data structures and algorithms when you're a front-end developer? Me too. Luckily, it isn't hard if you understand that algorithms and data structures are just more tools in your toolbox.\
\
For example, quicksort is a great tool to use when you need to sort arrays of objects (e.g., products in an ecommerce site, or [your creatures](https://brandonzpb.github.io/creatures)).\
\
(**Note**: Sorting is something that typically happens in the backend, so that you don't compromise the UI experience. Quicksort should also be used when you know you don't have many duplicates.)\
\
Now back to the good stuff. You can easily make a quicksort module to use whenever you need to provide the user with a sorted version of the provided array (say, they want to view the cheapest products first, or perhaps the ones with the highest ratings.)\

### What does it even mean to "think like a programmer"?\
\
In this tutorial we'll review the following, what I like to call the 10 Commandments of Programming:\
\
1. Live by SOLID Virtues and stay DRY (name things appropriately; code explains comments to the computer)
2. Learn the science of asking questions (to others and the rubber duck sitting beside you)
3. Know thyself (weaknesses, strengths, current knowledge)
4. Plan, plan, plan (expect bugs to occur)
5. Make good use of unhandled exceptions; bugs are indifferents (don't let yourself get angry; how to solve errors; comments are part of the debugging process (for you and anyone who reads your code); debugging is an art)
6. Practice is 80% of learning (ensure Flow; spaced-repetition; avoid tutorial hell)
7. Don't neglect the rest of computer science (data, algorithms, networks, security, testing, servers, UX/UI design)
8. Amor Fati; Codice Memento Mori (don't get attached to one programming language, framework, library, or way of doing things. This field is constantly changing)
9. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
10. Your life exists *outside* of the computer ("forget for a second that we aren't in a simulation..."; sleep, socializing, hobbies, stretching, exercise, diet, art, etc.)

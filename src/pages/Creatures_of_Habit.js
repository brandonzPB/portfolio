  const details = `
    The project that started it all. 
    I wanted a way to quantify areas of my life that are inherently qualitative (e.g., mental health, philosophy, etc.). 
    So I set out on learning to program from a background with zero prior experience or expertise, 
    and I ended up creating a "full-stack" web application that me and my friends use today.
  `

    "React (JavaScript)",
    "React Context API",
    "CSS",
    "NodeJS",
    "Express",
    "NoSQL",
    "JSONWebTokens",

  const purpose = `
    After seeing so many "Life RPG" apps, I was inspired to make my own version that had all the features I wanted 
    that the others lacked. So the purpose of this app is to do just that: provide a nostalgic alternative 
    to apps that measure areas of your life the way a video game measures experience points and character evolution.
  `

  const tech = `
    I used React to create this project because it seemed like the best choice, with its packages, hooks, and state management. 
    I also used NodeJS and Express to create the server because I really enjoy building with JavaScript and I was eager to learn how to 
    make a "full-stack" web app with just one programming language. I also used MongoDB because of the scalable cloud services it provides. 
  `

  const lessons = `
    The number of lessons I learned from this project alone is too many to detail in a simple paragraph! 
    Firstly, due to the complex structure of the "creature" objects, I learned a tremendous amount about the importance of refactoring code 
    and building a project that is clean and easy to maintain. 
    I also learned about the importance of writing unit tests before coding any of the project itself. 
    Another important concept I learned was the necessity of having a plan when designing any project: I learned what 
    works for me, how to mitigate my weaknesses, and make great use of my strengths. I used this plan when creating mindful.io.

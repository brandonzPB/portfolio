Welcome to my blog!\
\
I'm going to be making programming tutorials regularly. I will be teaching everything I've learned and have been
learning since first starting this life-long educational pursuit. If you want to learn more about computer science,
improve your programming skills, and make fun projects, then feel free to come back any time! If you don't like my teaching style, 
please don't hesitate to send me an email and I'll quickly respond with a great list of other awesome people who make tutorials 
differently than me. If I have any errors in my code that I missed, feel free to let me know.\
\
That's all for now. Stay tuned!
